  overview:
    summary: "S3 Protection monitors object-level S3 APIs and bucket configurations to detect discovery, exfiltration, policy modifications, and unauthorized access. Uses ML anomaly detection and threat intelligence to identify suspicious S3 activity patterns."

    frequency_notes: "S3 findings vary widely - discovery/enumeration (50-200/hour), exfiltration attempts (10-50/hour), policy changes (5-20/day), public exposure events (1-10/day). Frequency scales with S3 API volume and data access patterns."
