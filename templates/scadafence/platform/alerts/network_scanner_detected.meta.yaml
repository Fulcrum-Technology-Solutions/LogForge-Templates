  overview:
    summary: "Alert generated when an asset is identified as performing network scanning activity, sending requests to multiple assets/ports in the OT network"
    when_generated:
      - "When an asset scans multiple IP addresses or ports in a short time period"
      - "When reconnaissance patterns are detected in OT network traffic"
      - "When potentially malicious scanning activity is observed"
      - "When legitimate scanning tools are detected (management platforms)"
    security_relevance: "High"
    compliance_frameworks:
      - "NIST CSF (Detect)"
      - "IEC 62443 (Industrial Automation Security)"
      - "NERC CIP"
      - "ISA/IEC 62443"
    frequency_notes: "Medium frequency - approximately 8-12 alerts per hour during normal operations. Higher frequency during night hours when unauthorized scanning may occur (2.0x multiplier). Lower on weekends (0.3x) as legitimate management activities decrease."
