  overview:
    summary: "Security findings generated by Google Cloud Security Command Center V2, providing centralized visibility into security threats, misconfigurations, and compliance violations across Google Cloud Platform resources."
    when_generated:
      - "When Security Command Center detects a custom threat pattern"
      - "When security policies are violated"
      - "When anomalous activity is detected on GCP resources"
      - "When vulnerability scanners identify security issues"
      - "When compliance violations are detected"
    security_relevance: "High"
    compliance_frameworks:
      - "CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark"
      - "ISO 27001"
      - "SOC 2"
      - "PCI DSS"
      - "HIPAA"
    frequency_notes: "Security findings are generated based on continuous monitoring of GCP resources. Frequency varies based on security posture, with more findings during active development periods and fewer during stable operations. Business hours typically see higher finding rates due to increased resource changes and deployments."
