  overview:
    summary: "Toxic combination findings identify groups of security issues that, when they occur together, create a path to one or more of your high-value resources that a determined attacker could potentially use to reach and compromise those resources."
    when_generated:
      - "Service account with Owner role has public IP access"
      - "Bucket with public read access contains sensitive data classification"
      - "Compute instance with external IP has overly permissive firewall rules"
      - "IAM binding grants multiple high-privilege roles to same principal"
      - "Network allows unrestricted egress with sensitive data access"
    security_relevance: "Critical"
    compliance_frameworks:
      - "NIST 800-53 (AC-3, SC-7)"
      - "ISO 27001 (A.9.1.2, A.13.1.1)"
      - "CIS GCP Foundation 2.0"
      - "SOC 2 (CC6.1)"
    frequency_notes: "Toxic combination findings are generated by Security Graph analysis when multiple security issues combine to create attack paths. Frequency is lower than individual findings but represents higher risk scenarios. These findings require immediate attention as they indicate exploitable attack paths."
