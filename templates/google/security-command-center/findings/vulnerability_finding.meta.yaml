  overview:
    summary: "Vulnerability findings identify flaws or weaknesses in software programs, containers, or configurations that attackers could exploit to compromise Google Cloud resources. These findings are generated by various Security Command Center scanners."
    when_generated:
      - "Container Threat Detection identifies vulnerable packages in container images"
      - "VM Manager detects OS-level vulnerabilities on compute instances"
      - "Web Security Scanner finds application vulnerabilities"
      - "Security Health Analytics identifies weak SSL ciphers or open firewall rules"
      - "Vulnerability Assessment scans identify CVE vulnerabilities"

      - "PCI-DSS (6.2)"
      - "SOC 2 (CC7.2)"
    frequency_notes: "Vulnerability findings are generated during scheduled scans and continuous monitoring. Frequency depends on the number of resources, scan frequency, and vulnerability landscape. New vulnerabilities are typically discovered during business hours when scans are scheduled, but findings can appear at any time."
