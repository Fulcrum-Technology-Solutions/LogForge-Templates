  overview:
    summary: "Chokepoint findings identify a resource or resource group where high-risk attack paths converge, based on attack path simulations. Remediating a chokepoint finding might remediate multiple toxic combinations."
    when_generated:
      - "Single network path provides access to multiple high-value resources"
      - "Service account acts as gateway to multiple sensitive data sources"
      - "Firewall rule creates single point of access for critical systems"
      - "IAM role grants access to multiple critical resources through one principal"
      - "Load balancer routes traffic to all backend services without segmentation"
    security_relevance: "Critical"
    compliance_frameworks:
      - "NIST 800-53 (SC-7, AC-3)"
      - "ISO 27001 (A.13.1.1, A.9.1.2)"
      - "CIS GCP Foundation 2.0"
      - "SOC 2 (CC6.1)"
    frequency_notes: "Chokepoint findings are generated by Security Graph analysis when attack path simulations identify convergence points. These are rare but critical findings that represent single points of failure in security architecture. Remediating chokepoints can eliminate multiple attack paths simultaneously."
