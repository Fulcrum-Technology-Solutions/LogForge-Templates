  overview:
    summary: "Posture violation findings describe resource configurations that don't align with your organization's security posture templates or Compliance Manager cloud controls. These findings help maintain consistent security standards across GCP resources."
    when_generated:
      - "Resources don't meet Secure by Default posture template requirements"
      - "Compliance standard controls are violated (CIS, NIST, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001)"
      - "Organization security policies are not followed"
      - "Custom posture constraints are violated"
