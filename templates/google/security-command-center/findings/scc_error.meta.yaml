  overview:
    summary: "SCC Error findings identify problems in the configuration of Security Command Center or one of its services that prevent Security Command Center from detecting security issues in your Google Cloud environment. These errors must be resolved to ensure proper security monitoring."
    when_generated:
      - "Security scanner fails to access resources due to insufficient permissions"
      - "API authentication fails when attempting to scan resources"
      - "Resource is deleted or moved during scan operation"
      - "Scan operation exceeds time limit"
      - "Organization quota for security scans has been exceeded"
      - "Invalid scanner configuration is detected"
    security_relevance: "High"
    compliance_frameworks:
      - "NIST 800-53 (SI-4)"
      - "ISO 27001 (A.12.4.1)"
      - "SOC 2 (CC7.2)"
      - "CIS GCP Foundation 2.0"
    frequency_notes: "SCC Error findings are generated when Security Command Center services encounter configuration or operational issues. Frequency is typically low but can spike during misconfigurations or when service quotas are exceeded. These errors should be resolved promptly to restore security monitoring capabilities."
