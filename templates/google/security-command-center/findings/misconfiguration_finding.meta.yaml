  overview:
    summary: "Misconfiguration findings identify vulnerabilities caused by incorrect or suboptimal configuration of GCP resources. These findings can typically be fixed by updating the resource configuration to follow security best practices."
    when_generated:
      - "Cloud Storage buckets have public access enabled"
      - "Service accounts have overly permissive IAM roles"
      - "Firewall rules allow unrestricted access (0.0.0.0/0)"
      - "Compute instances use legacy networks"
      - "SSL/TLS policies use weak ciphers"
      - "Audit logging is disabled for critical services"
      - "Resources have public IP addresses unnecessarily"
    security_relevance: "High"
    compliance_frameworks:
      - "CIS GCP Foundation 2.0"
      - "NIST 800-53 (CM-6, AC-3)"

      - "PCI-DSS (1.2, 2.1)"
      - "SOC 2 (CC6.1)"
    frequency_notes: "Misconfiguration findings are generated during continuous security posture assessments. Frequency increases during business hours when resources are actively being created or modified. Findings may reactivate if configurations are reverted to insecure states."
