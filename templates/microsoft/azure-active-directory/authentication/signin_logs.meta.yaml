  overview:
    summary: "Comprehensive authentication logs from Azure Active Directory capturing user sign-in events, multi-factor authentication, conditional access policy evaluation, and device compliance status. Essential for security monitoring and compliance reporting."
    when_generated:
      - "Every time a user signs into any Azure AD connected application"
      - "During multi-factor authentication challenges"
      - "When conditional access policies are evaluated"
      - "During password changes and user registration events"
      - "For both interactive and non-interactive authentication"
    security_relevance: "High - Primary source for detecting authentication anomalies, brute force attacks, impossible travel, compromised accounts, and policy violations"
