  overview:
    summary: "Simulates CLOP ransomware service installation events. CLOP is a sophisticated ransomware family that uses specific service names ('SecurityCenterIBM', 'WinCheckDRVs') for persistence and privilege escalation. This template generates events matching known CLOP TTPs for detection rule testing and SOC training."
    when_generated:
      - "During CLOP ransomware deployment phase"
      - "For persistence establishment on compromised Windows systems"
      - "In red team exercises simulating CLOP campaign tactics"
