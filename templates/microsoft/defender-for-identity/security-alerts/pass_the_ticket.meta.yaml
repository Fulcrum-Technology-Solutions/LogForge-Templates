  overview:
    summary: "Detects pass-the-ticket attacks where attackers steal Kerberos tickets from one machine and use them on another to move laterally through the network. This is a critical indicator of advanced persistent threats and Active Directory compromise."
    when_generated:
      - "When stolen Kerberos tickets are detected being used from different machines"
      - "During lateral movement activities in compromised environments"
      - "When attackers attempt to escalate privileges using stolen credentials"
      - "As part of advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns"
    security_relevance: "Critical - Pass-the-ticket attacks indicate sophisticated adversaries with existing network access attempting lateral movement. Immediate investigation and containment required."
    compliance_frameworks:
      - "NIST Cybersecurity Framework"
      - "MITRE ATT&CK Framework"
      - "SOC 2"
      - "ISO 27001"
      - "PCI DSS"
    frequency_notes: "Very rare in legitimate environments (0.5 events/hour baseline). Higher frequency during off-hours suggests active compromise. Most alerts should be investigated as potential true positives."
