notes: 'This template generates Microsoft Defender for Identity alert events for Pass-the-Ticket
  attacks.

  Pass-the-Ticket is an attack technique where an attacker extracts Kerberos tickets
  from one

  system and reuses them on another system to impersonate a user.


  These alerts simulate suspicious Kerberos ticket usage that might indicate lateral
  movement

  in an environment.


  The template uses:

  - Random GUID generation for unique identifiers

  - Timestamp manipulation for realistic alert timelines

  - Entity registry to populate user and device information

  - Organization domain information for realistic naming

  '
