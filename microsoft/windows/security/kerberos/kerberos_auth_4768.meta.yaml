notes: 'This template generates Windows Security event logs for successful Kerberos
  TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) requests.

  Event ID 4768 indicates that a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested.


  The template uses random users and devices from the entity registry and generates:

  - Random SIDs for target users and services

  - Random encryption types and ticket options

  - Random source IP addresses and ports

  - Timestamps based on the current time


  These events are common on Windows domain controllers and represent normal authentication
  activity.

  They can be used to track user logons and authentication patterns.s'
