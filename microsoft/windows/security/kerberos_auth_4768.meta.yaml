# Documentation

  This template generates Windows Security event logs for successful Kerberos TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) requests.
  Event ID 4768 indicates that a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested.
  
  The template uses random users and devices from the entity registry and generates:
  - Random SIDs for target users and services
  - Random encryption types and ticket options
  - Random source IP addresses and ports
  - Timestamps based on the current time
  
  These events are common on Windows domain controllers and represent normal authentication activity.
  They can be used to track user logons and authentication patterns.s
