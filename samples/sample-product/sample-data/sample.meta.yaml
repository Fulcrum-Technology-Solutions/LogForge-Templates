# Log Template Metadata File
# This file defines the properties of the log template for documentation and generation

# Basic log identification information
vendor: "Vendor Name"               # Organization that produces the software/device generating this log type
product: "Product Name"             # Specific product or application name
data_source: "Event Source Name"    # Specific event type or source within the product
description: "Detailed description of what this log represents and when it's generated"

frequency: "medium"                 # General categorization of event frequency (high, medium, low)

# Generator settings for controlling log generation patterns
is_generator: true                  # Indicates this template is used for log generation
base_frequency: 0.1                 # Base events per minute (adjusted by multipliers)
time_patterns:                      # Time patterns this generator should follow
  - business_hours                  # Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm
  - night_hours                     # Mon-Fri, 5pm-9am
  - weekend                         # Sat-Sun, all day
business_hours_multiplier: 1.5      # Increases frequency during business hours
night_hours_multiplier: 0.2         # Reduces frequency during non-business hours
weekend_multiplier: 0.3             # Reduces frequency during weekends

# Context values for template rendering (default values)
