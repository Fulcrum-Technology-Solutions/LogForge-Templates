notes: 'This template generates realistic web traffic logs for Zscaler Internet Access
  (ZIA),

  a cloud security service that inspects web traffic.


  The logs include:

  - User information and authentication details

  - Device details including OS, model, and custom fields

  - HTTP/HTTPS request/response data

  - Security scanning results and threat detection

  - TLS/SSL connection information

  - Bandwidth and sizing metrics

  - URL categorization and policy enforcement


  The template demonstrates:

  - Using random user and device entities from the registry

  - Setting and reusing variables for consistent log data

  - Creating realistic web traffic patterns with appropriate methods, status codes,
  and sizes

  - Including realistic threat names and categories when threats are detected

  - Accessing custom device fields with fallbacks when fields are not defined


  Each log entry represents a single web request passing through the Zscaler cloud
  proxy,

  with appropriate metadata about the security scanning performed.


  Roughly 20% of generated logs will include detected threats with specific threat
  names,

  categories, and appropriate action (BLOCK) and status code (403) values.
