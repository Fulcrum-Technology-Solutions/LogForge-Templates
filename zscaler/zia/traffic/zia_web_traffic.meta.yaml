  This template generates realistic web traffic logs for Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA),
  a cloud security service that inspects web traffic.
  
  The logs include:
  - User information and authentication details
  - Device details including OS, model, and custom fields
  - HTTP/HTTPS request/response data
  - Security scanning results and threat detection
  - TLS/SSL connection information
  - Bandwidth and sizing metrics
  - URL categorization and policy enforcement
  
  The template demonstrates:
  - Using random user and device entities from the registry
  - Setting and reusing variables for consistent log data
  - Creating realistic web traffic patterns with appropriate methods, status codes, and sizes
  - Including realistic threat names and categories when threats are detected
  - Accessing custom device fields with fallbacks when fields are not defined
  
  Each log entry represents a single web request passing through the Zscaler cloud proxy,
  with appropriate metadata about the security scanning performed.
  
  Roughly 20% of generated logs will include detected threats with specific threat names,
  categories, and appropriate action (BLOCK) and status code (403) values.
