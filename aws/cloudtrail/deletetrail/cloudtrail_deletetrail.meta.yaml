notes: 'This template generates AWS CloudTrail logs for DeleteTrail operations in
  Amazon Security Lake OCSF format.


  DeleteTrail operations are security-relevant as they could indicate an attacker
  trying to cover their tracks

  by removing audit logging capabilities. These events are often used in security
  monitoring to detect potential

  defense evasion techniques (MITRE ATT&CK T1562.008).


  The template uses:

  - random_guid() for generating unique identifiers

  - current_timestamp() for event timestamps

  - random_int() for account IDs and other numeric values

  - random_string() for credential UIDs and other string identifiers

  - random_public_ip() for source IP addresses

  - registry functions to access user entities from the entity registry
